open-selected-links
===================
This is a Greasemonkey script that will open each link
in the selected text in a new tab i.e. each link will
be opened in it's own tab.

UPDATE: 03-06-2010
------------------
Selected links are only opened when the ctrl / cmd key is
depressed when selecting the text.
